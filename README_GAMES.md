UltraOP — Gaming Section Update
===============================

What I replaced:
- Replaced `games.html`, `games.css`, and `games.js` with a modular, improved gaming section.
- Backups of originals are in `backup_games_20250808_180719` inside the same folder.

Files added/updated:
- games.html — self-contained games landing page (links to games.css & games.js)
- games.css  — fresh futuristic UI/UX styling
- games.js   — modular games, leaderboards (localStorage), achievements, social share

How it works (quick):
1. Open `games.html` in a browser (from the website root).
2. Enter a player name in the header (optional) — saved to localStorage.
3. Click PLAY for any game. After finishing, use 'Save to Leaderboard' to store top scores.
4. Leaderboards and achievements are stored in `localStorage` keys:
   - Leaderboards: `ultraop_lb_<gameId>`
   - Achievements: `ultraop_achievements_v1`
5. To reset leaderboards, clear these keys from the developer console: `localStorage.removeItem('ultraop_lb_<gameId>')`

New games included:
- Snake (classic)
- Tic-Tac-Toe (vs simple AI)
- Memory Match (pair cards)
- Gully Cricket (timing batting mini-game — culturally resonant)

Extending / Integrating:
- To include this gaming section into your site, add a link or route to `games.html`.
- To make leaderboards global, replace localStorage calls in `games.js` with API calls to your backend or Firebase.
- Achievement rules are defined in each game's `achievementRules` static property. Edit or add rules there.
- To add a new game: create a class with static id/name/icon and constructor(container, hooks). Register it inside GameManager.loadGames().

Monetization & Ads Tips:
- Use rewarded ads only inside games (e.g., "Watch ad to continue" or "double rewards") — this preserves UX.
- Add soft ad placements in side panels between leaderboard entries (non-intrusive).

If you'd like, I can:
- Add Firebase backend for global leaderboards and remote achievements.
- Add per-user account integration (so saving players cross-device).
- Add animations, sounds, and more games (Carrom / Ludo) with multiplayer support (more complex).
